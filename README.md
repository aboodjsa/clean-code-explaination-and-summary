Chapter 2: Meaningful Names
Brief Explanation & Summary:
This chapter explains the importance of using clear and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes. Names should reveal intent and describe what the code is doing without requiring extra explanation. Poor naming makes code harder to read and understand, while good naming reduces confusion and minimizes the need for comments. Meaningful names improve readability and make collaboration between developers more effective.


Chapter 3: Functions
Brief Explanation & Summary:
Chapter 3 focuses on writing clean functions that are small, focused, and easy to understand. Each function should perform a single task and do it well. Functions should have descriptive names and as few parameters as possible. Breaking large functions into smaller ones improves code organization, testing, and long-term maintenance.


Chapter 4: Comments
Brief Explanation & Summary:
This chapter emphasizes that comments should not be used to compensate for unclear code. Instead, code should be written in a way that clearly expresses its intent. Comments are most useful when explaining why a decision was made or when clarifying complex logic. Overusing comments can make code harder to maintain if the comments become outdated.



Chapter 6: Objects and Data Structures
Brief Explanation & Summary:
Chapter 6 discusses the difference between objects and data structures. Objects hide their internal data and expose behavior through methods, while data structures expose data with little or no behavior. Understanding when to use objects versus data structures helps developers design cleaner, more flexible, and more maintainable software systems.
